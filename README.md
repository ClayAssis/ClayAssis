### - _Cientista de dados | Data scientist_
### - _Analista de dados | Data analyst_
### - _Bioinformata | Bioinformatics_

I am a Data Science and Data analyst currently Freelance.
My main object is to build data-product powered by Machine Learning to increase company revenue and reduce costs as well.

I completed the undergraduate course in Biological Sciences at Universidade Santa Úrsula. I entered as an intern (scientific initiation) in the ornithology sector of the National Museum/UFRJ where he developed his monograph on taxonomy. While still at this institution, studying a postgraduate course in Zoology, I also completed a Master's degree in taxonomy and developed my Doctorate in Molecular Systematics and Taxonomy. I have a Post-Doctorate at the University of São Paulo and at the Federal University of Riode Janeiro.

During this period I developed my skills in data analysis, machine learning and bioinformatics. With that I gained vast knowledge in tools like Python and R. I also worked in several research groups and supervised master's and doctoral students.

As a professional, I always pushed myself forward to learn skills to become an independent Data Scientist, able to build an end-to-end project, since the data collection up to ML models creation and deployment. 

At this point in my career, I feel confident about my expertise and ability to build relevant solutions to improve company results and thus, make me an outstanding professional.

## **Analytical Tools** 

**Data Collect and Storage:** SQL.

**Data Processing and Analysis:** R, Python, .

**Development Tools:** Git, heroku and Linux.

**Machine Learning:** Classification, Regression, Clustering, Time Series, Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning (image classification).

## Data Science Projects:

### BirdVisionBR

The project aims to generate a classifier and object detection of Brazilian Birds by image. For this, photos from the WikiAves website (https://www.wikiaves.com.br/) are being used used.

### [Cardiovascular Disease Detection]( https://github.com/ClayAssis/Predicting-Cardiovascular-Diseases )

Building a Machine Learning Model to detect cardiovascular disease in early stages leverage the diagnostic precision made by health professionals.  
In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model able to detect disease in early stages with **65% accuracy** over 70k patience.
The performance of this model would increase **revenue of U$81.2 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.


### [Fraud Detection]( https://github.com/ClayAssis/Blocker-Fraud-Company ) 

Machine Learning and taking fraud detection to the next level. Companies are reducing their costs with detecting fraudulent transactions, while companies providing theses types of services are increasing thier income.
In this project, I built a Machine Learning classifier to label fraudulent transactions with **99.63% of accuracy.**
The performance of this model would bring **revenue of U$877,5 millions** according to the company's business model described in the problem definition.
### [Health Insurance Cross-Sell]( https://github.com/ClayAssis/HEALTH-INSURANCE-CROSS-SELL-PREDICTION ) 

Insurance All is a company that provides vehicle insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: health insurance.

As with vehicle insurance, customers of this new health insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All conducted a survey of about 380,000 customers about their interest in joining a new health insurance product last year. All customers expressed interest or not in purchasing health insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127 thousand new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive the offer of the new health insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through telephone calls.

However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20 thousand calls within the campaign period.
